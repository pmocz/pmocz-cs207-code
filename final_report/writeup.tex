\begin{abstract}
We implement a second-order magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solver which uses the constrained transport (CT) algorithm on a 2D unstructured triangular mesh. We have extended the CT method to such unstructured grids, which allows for the evolution of magnetic fields in a divergence-free way to machine precision. Our code has interactive features which allow the user to set initial conditions and perturb the evolution of the simulation in real time. The fluid variables in the simulations are visualized with colored triangular faces. We present three classical tests: [1] a 2D implosion, [2] a magnetic Sedov-Taylor-like blast wave, [3] a version of the Orszag-Tang test with reflective boundary conditions, which models decaying supersonic turbulence. The code also has an interactive mode where the user defines a 2-phase fluid separated by a dividing line. In all the simulations, the user can also click the environment to inject energy into the fluid at the location of the click.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Simulating magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on unstructured grids is a challenging task. Standard finite volume (FV) methods are unstable due to their inability to maintain a divergence­free magnetic field. One particular solution to this problem is to use constrained transport (CT; also called the ‘staggered­grid approach’), which has been developed for Cartesian grids, and recently extended to unstructured Voronoi meshes \citep{2014arXiv1402.5963M}. Here we will adapt the method to triangular meshes. With this powerful tool, we can study a variety of MHD problems. Much insight can be gained if we can easily change the initial conditions interactively and perturb the simulations while visualizing it in real time.

In \S~\ref{sec:ct} we outline the procedure to solve the MHD equations. In \S~\ref{sec:viz} we describe our extension of the SDLViewer to visualize shaded triangles. In \S~\ref{sec:interactivity} we describe how to incorporate interactivity into the simulations. Finally, in \S~\ref{sec:examples} we present examples from running our code.


\section{CT Method on Unstructured Triangular Mesh}\label{sec:ct}

We implemented a second-order MHD solver. The general framework of the method follows that of \cite{2014arXiv1402.5963M}, which can be consulted for full implementation details. We point out here important modifications needed to adapt the method to an unstructured triangular mesh.

The ideal MHD equations can be written as a system of conservation laws:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \mathbf{U}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{U}$ is the vector of the conserved variables and $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{U})$ is the flux, namely:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{U} = \begin{pmatrix} \rho \\ \rho\mathbf{v} \\ \rho e \\ \mathbf{B} \end{pmatrix},
\,\,\,\,\,\,
\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{U}) = 
\begin{pmatrix} \rho\mathbf{v} \\ \rho\mathbf{v}\mathbf{v}^T + p -\mathbf{B}\mathbf{B}^T \\ \rho e \mathbf{v} + p\mathbf{v} -\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{B}) \\ \mathbf{B}\mathbf{v}^T-\mathbf{v}\mathbf{B}^T \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $p=p_{\rm gas}+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{B}^2$ is the total gas pressure, $e=u+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{v}^2+\frac{1}{2\rho}\mathbf{B}^2$ is the total energy per unit mass, $u$ is the thermal energy per unit mass. The equation of state for the fluid is given by $p=(\gamma-1)\rho u$.

We solve the MHD equations on a 2D triangular mesh, using the mesh class developed in HW4. The fluid variables $\rho$, $\rho\mathbf{v}$, and $\rho e$ are evolved according to a second-order finite volume approach with second-order Runge-Kutta timestepping. Fluxes across triangular faces are calculated using the local-Lax-Friedrichs flux. The finite volume approach evolves cell-averaged fluid quantities. The achieve second-order accuracy we calculate gradients of the fluid quantities and use them to extrapolate fluid quantities out to the cell faces for the calculation of the fluxes. We also implement a slope-limiter to prevent numerical oscillations in the presence of discontinuities due to shocks.

The magnetic field is represented by triangle face-averaged quantities, in accordance with the CT scheme. For each edge $e_{ij}$ shared by triangles $t_i$ and $t_j$ in the mesh, we store the magnetic flux $\Phi_{ij}$ across the face. The magnetic fluxes are updated in each timestep according to 
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{ij}^{(n+1)} = \Phi_{ij}^{(n)} - \Delta t (E^{(n+1/2)}_{L,ij} - E^{(n+1/2)}_{R,ij})
\label{eqn:evo6}
\end{equation}
where $E^{(n+1/2)}_{L,ij}$ and $E^{(n+1/2)}_{R,ij}$ are estimates for the $z$-component of the electric fields at left and right nodes ($n_{L,ij}$ and $n_{R,ij}$) of the face in the middle of the timestep. 

The divergence of $\mathbf{B}$ can be estimated using Stokes' theorem as:
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}_i = \frac{1}{V_i}\sum_j \Phi_{ij} 
\label{eqn:div}
\end{equation}
which is kept zero at the level of machine precision by our evolution rule as long as the initial conditions have zero divergence.

The $z$-component of the electric field $E_{n_i}$ at the node $n_i$ is estimated from the electric fields at the adjacent faces, which in turn are obtained from the magnetic-field components of the Lax-Friedrichs flux across the faces. We interpolate the electric fields at the face to the nodes according to the rule:
\begin{equation}
  E_{n_i} =  \frac{\sum_{e_k\in\mathcal{E}(n_i)}  \frac{1}{|e_k|}E_{e_k} }{\sum_{\frac{1}{|e_k|}}}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{E}(n_i)$ is the set of adjacent edges to node $n_i$, $|e_k|$ is the length of the edge $e_k$.

Finally, we can estimate cell-averaged magnetic fields $\mathcal{B}_{t_i}$ on triangle $t_i$ from the face-averaged magnetic fluxes by solving the matrix equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} 
n^x_{ij} & n^y_{ij} \\
n^x_{ik} & n^y_{ik} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
B^x_{t_i}\\
B^y_{t_i}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix} 
\Phi_{ij}/|e_{ij}| \\
\Phi_{ik}/|e_{ik}| \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $t_j$ and $t_k$ can be any 2 adjacent triangles to triangle $t_i$ (it can be proven that the method gives the same self-consistent answer for any choice of 2), $\mathbf{n}_{ij}, \mathbf{n}_{ik}$ are outward unit normal vectors at edges $e_{ij}$ and $e_{ik}$ respectively.

\section{Visualization}\label{sec:viz}

We implemented visualization of shaded triangles in {\tt SDLViewer.hpp} using {\tt GL\_TRIANGLES} objects, which are added to the viewer by our {\tt add\_triangle} method. The method has signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
void add_triangles(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, const Map& node_map)
\end{lstlisting}
The method shades the triangles by interpolating the colors of the nodes. The implementation follows the implementation of the edge shading quite closely.

\section{Interactivity}\label{sec:interactivity}

The {\tt SDLViewer.hpp} is also extended so that the user can add listeners for interactivity. A user-defined listener must inherit the structure:
\begin{lstlisting}
// An SDL Listener structure
struct SDL_Listener {
  virtual void handle(SDL_Event e) { (void) e;};
  friend class SDLViewer;
};
\end{lstlisting}
and the user must define their own {\tt handle} function to respond to SDL events (e.g. mouse clicks, keyboard input).

We implemented 2 listeners in our code: {\tt add\_energy\_listener} (injects energy to fluid at location of right-click) and {\tt set\_ic\_listener} (prompts user to set up 2-phase fluid initial conditions).
